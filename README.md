Each week this repository will be updated when I add the Weekly Session N.ipynb file, so it will be ideal if we practice forking and syncing on GitHub.

1.  Fork this repository to your GitHub account - this will make a copy on your account - it will be a public repo, NOT on the Physics-PacU page.
2.  Clone/download.  You can do two ways:
    * GUI (graphical user interface) - click the Clone/Download button on GitHub (as last week) - *unfortunately this doesn't always work as I expect, or end up in the directory I want it to.*
    * Terminal - this works!  
       * Open the Git Shell
       * Navigate to
